# sites

Some basic websites I work on for fun in my free time. Take a look through if you want, I guess. A few quick warnings about the site:  

 1. I'm constantly working on things and I tend to leave them in testing, so if you see out of place colored boxes anywhere on the page, the page is probably not going to work in some way.
 
 2. I made this site just for fun, I never really intended for other people to see it, so there are lots of broken links and pages that I haven't gotten around to fixing, updating, or removing.
 
 3. iluminatiSite and babblesoft were made in desktop chrome. Once I started triangleMenu I began testing in mobile chrome, firefox, and mobile firefox, so that one should work in all three.

### Layout

There are three parts to the site:

* **illuminatiSite**: My first attempt at a website, it's only purpose was to be a place for me to experiment with different visual styles; I made it about the illuminati because that was a running joke in my friend group at the time. After a while, I began putting other useful tools and small web-based projects on this site as well, so it has some mildly interesting extras to explore. It's files are very messy, and I often worked on the homepage and underlying javascript/css without updating the other pages once I was done, so it is very likely that many or all pages (other than the main page) will have broken headers and maybe body styles.

* **babblesoft**: An attempt of mine to use the framework of illuminatiSite to create a website for a fake technology site called "Babblesoft." It's just an adapted version of the homepage of illuminatiSite, and I never got too far on it. Looking back at it now I wonder how I chose such a hideous color scheme.

* **triangleMenu**: A single page I created to realize a menu idea I had. I am most proud of this page, because I'm very happy with the look and functionality of the menu (and that it almost uses only html and css). I was only thinking about the menu when I created this page, so the body of the page is copy/pasted from illuminatiSite (with some extra text added so I can still scroll while testing). Also, I created this page after I got a phone, so I was able to develop it for multiple platforms; it works on desktop and mobile for chrome and firefox. (I haven't tested on Safari or the Mac OS versions of those browsers though)
