# sites
Some basic websites I work on for fun in my free time. Take a look through if you want, I guess. Two quick warnings about the site: 
  1. I'm constantly working on things and I tend to leave them in testing, so if you see colored boxes anywhere on the page it's probably not going to work in some way.
  2. I made this site just for fun, I never really intended for other people to see it, so there are lots of broken links and pages that I haven't gotten around to fixing or removing. Pls don't judge -.-
