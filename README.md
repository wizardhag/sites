# sites
Some basic websites I work on for fun in my free time. Take a look through if you want, I guess. A few quick warnings about the site:  
 1. I'm constantly working on things and I tend to leave them in testing, so if you see out of place colored boxes anywhere on the page, the page is probably not going to work in some way.
 2. I made this site just for fun, I never really intended for other people to see it, so there are lots of broken links and pages that I haven't gotten around to fixing, updating, or removing. Pls don't judge -.-
 3. This site was made in desktop chrome. I have recently started testing in mobile and firefox to make sure it works there too, but that is definitely still a work in progress.  

##Layout

There are three parts to the site:
* **illuminatiSite**: My first attempt at a website, it's only purpose was to be a place for me to experiment with different visual styles. After a while, I began putting other useful tools and small web-based projects on this site as well, so it actually has some interesting extras to explore. It's files are very messy, and I often worked on the homepage and underlying javascript/css without updating the other pages once I was done, so it is very likely that many pages will have broken headers.
* **babblesoft**: An attempt of mine to use the framework of illuminatiSite to create a website for a fake technology site called "Babblesoft." It's just an adapted version of the homepage of illuminatiSite. Looking back at it now I wonder how I chose such a hideous color scheme. (Those yellows don't work for me at all)
* **triangleMenu**: A single page I created to realize a menu idea I had. I am most proud of this page, because I'm very happy with the look and functionality of the menu (and that it uses only html and css). I was only thinking about the menu when I created this page, so the body of the page is copy/pasted from illuminatiSite (with some extra text added so scrolling is still necessary on larger screens for testing). Also, I created this page after I got a phone, so I was able to develop it for multiple platforms; it works on desktop and mobile for chrome and firefox. (I haven't tested on MacOS versions of the browsers though)
