body style guide:
- If possible with whatever content is chosen, use full screen width:
	> Remove body_div
	> If it fits with site use, add menu on the left (unlikely)
		* Must be dynamic - has a set width on computers, disappears for tablets/phones
		* Possibly collapsable, and possibly not in full screen but uncollapseable for tablets/phones
	> Use sections that are full width to divide up content
		* Sections should be modular, so you can list any combination in any order easily
		* Have an overall section class have several other classes to determine what type of section it is
		* Most sections will need to be dynamic to change style depending on the device as talked about below
		* All pages will have a footer section
- Sites need different looks depending on the device:
	> Computers: Spread out, several things going on can be good, not too simple looking
	> Tablets: Big blocks/pictures/icons; can be full-width pictues as headers or attention-grabbers, in-text or full-width for illustrations, and 2- to 4-column layouts as menus or lists
	> Phones: Vertical text lists, all pictures are full-width or in 2-column layouts
